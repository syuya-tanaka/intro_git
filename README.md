# intro_git
My first trial. Dose not have a function.

# Description
Not particularly.

# Demo
Here is a place to describe how the tool actually works.
It's better to be able to visually explain how it works.

# Usage
Describe what commands are used to run the tool.
In the demo, I described the result of working, but here I write the instruction to work.

# Requirement
Write down the environment to use.
It is up to the individual to write in detail.
Be sure to write the version of the library that is the base of the tool.

# Install
If you created a product to be installed locally, write down the installation method as well.

# Note
In addition, write supplementary information and remarks.

# Author
I will list the person responsible for writing this article.

# License
In order to publish to the sea of the net, it is necessary to firmly establish a license.
But default copyright law applies to source code that does not specify a license, as shown on this page.
